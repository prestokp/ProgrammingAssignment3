loadStudentNameGrades opens and read fileName. It will read in two strings, concatenate them, and then save
to the students array. It then reads five integers and save each to the grades array. The function will return
the actual number of student/grade combinations read
PARAM:	students is an array of strings that can hold up ot maxStudents values
		grades is a two dimensional array for holding the grades of each student
		fileName is the name of the file that will be opened and read
		maxStudents is the maximum number of students that we will read from the file
PRE:	students[] is large enough to contain up to maxStudents elements
		grades[] is large enough ot contain up to maxStudents elements
POST:	students[] contains the names of up to maxStudents
		grades[][] contains the grades for up to maxStudents
		The number of student/grade combinations actually read from the file is returned. This value can range
		between 0 <= numStudents <= maxStudents
NOTE:	students[] and grades[] are meant to be parralel arrays. students[0] and grades[0] are the same student
